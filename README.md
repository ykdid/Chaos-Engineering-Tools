# Chaos Engineering Tools
 Implementing Chaos Engineering for Resilience Cloud Infrastructure

I used python language for implementations and i imported some libraries (boto3 , math, random, datetime ) boto3 is  allows interacting with AWS services from Python code.

I did two Chaos Engineering Tool implementations these are : 
Chaos Monkey and Security Monkey

My Chaos Monkey code uses for  automate the management of container instances in an Elastic Container Service (ECS) environment on AWS (Amazon Web Services) infrastructure. The code changes the state of container instances in a specific ECS cluster at a specific time period.

My Security Monkey code designed to manage security groups located on AWS (Amazon Web Services) infrastructure. It makes random changes to security groups on a given AWS account.
